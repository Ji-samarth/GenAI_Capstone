# 📋 Credit Risk Evaluator

A machine learning-powered web application that predicts loan default risk using a Decision Tree Classifier trained on 32,581 historical loan records.

## Overview

This project builds a **binary classification model** to predict whether a borrower will default on a loan. It takes applicant information (age, income, employment history) and loan details (amount, grade, interest rate, purpose) as inputs and outputs a risk assessment with default probability.

The model is deployed as an interactive **Streamlit web application** with real-time predictions.

## Features

- 🎯 **Real-time risk prediction** — enter applicant details and get an instant credit risk assessment
- 📊 **Three-tier decision output** — Approved (< 20% risk), Needs Review (20–50%), Rejected (> 50%)
- 🌗 **Light & dark mode** — responsive design that adapts to system theme
- ⚡ **Cached model training** — model trains once and is cached for fast subsequent predictions

## Model Performance

| Metric                    | Value      |
| ------------------------- | ---------- |
| Accuracy                  | **90.81%** |
| ROC-AUC                   | 0.6817     |
| F1-Score (Default Class)  | 0.79       |
| Precision (Default Class) | 0.81       |
| Recall (Default Class)    | 0.77       |

Two models were compared — Logistic Regression (84.5% accuracy, 0.86 ROC-AUC) and Decision Tree (90.8% accuracy, 0.68 ROC-AUC). The **Decision Tree** was selected for deployment due to higher accuracy and better recall on the default class.

## Limitations

- Binary default history (no partial defaults)
- Moderate ROC-AUC suggests scope for probability calibration
- Class imbalance handled via class weighting
